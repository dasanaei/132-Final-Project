# ENGR 132 Final Project

## Introduction

A mock scenario was presented in which an organization (FOS Inc.) that manufactered thermocouple devices required analysis in their data. They specifically wanted the following deliverables:
 1. Construct an algorithm (and implement it in MATLAB) to analyze thermocouple time history data. Then, create a detailed description of the analysis of the dataset provided, including clear and easy-to-understand graphics that summarize the data.
2. Provide an error analysis that characterizes the accuracy of your approach to determining time constant and other performance characteristics of the system.
3. Draft a recommendation about what FOS can honestly and ethically claim to its customers about the performance of the new designs.

 A more detailed introduction can be found in the "Introduction" folder within the repository

 ## How to run
 - To visualize the data presented in the final deliverable, run the `Project_M4Exec_014_07` file in matlab. 
 - To visualize the thermocouple analysis algorithm itself enter the "Milestone 2" folder and run `Project_M2AlgExec_014_07`.
